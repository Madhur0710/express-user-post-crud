This project is a simple web application built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB using Mongoose. It demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for users and posts, along with user authentication (registration, login, logout) using bcrypt for password hashing and JWT for session management. The frontend is rendered using EJS templates.
