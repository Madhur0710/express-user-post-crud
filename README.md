This project is a simple web application built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB using Mongoose. It demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for users and posts, along with user authentication (registration, login, logout) using bcrypt for password hashing and JWT for session management. The frontend is rendered using EJS templates.

## Features
- **User Registration and Login**: Secure user registration and login with password hashing and JWT-based session management.
- **CRUD Operations for Posts**: Create, read, update, and delete posts associated with users.
- **Likes on Posts**: Like and unlike posts.
- **Profile Management**: View user profile with associated posts.
- **Protected Routes**: Middleware to protect routes and ensure only authenticated users can access certain features.
